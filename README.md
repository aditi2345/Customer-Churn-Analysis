# Customer Churn Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using machine learning techniques. It aims to understand the key factors that lead to customer churn and to develop predictive models that can help businesses retain their customers. The analysis and modeling process is documented in the HTML report.
# Files
Aditi-Datta_Customer-Churn.html: This HTML file contains the complete report, including data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The document provides insights into customer churn patterns and the performance of various models in predicting churn.
# Project Structure
Data Exploration: In-depth examination of the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and potential indicators of churn.
Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into meaningful features to improve model accuracy.
# Modeling: 
Implementation of machine learning models to predict churn, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization are also included in this step.
